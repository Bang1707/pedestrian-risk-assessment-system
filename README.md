# Pedestrian Risk Assessment System (PRAS)

A vision-based pedestrian collision risk estimation system built using object detection, custom tracking, and time-to-collision (TTC) modeling.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to estimate pedestrian collision risk from video input using:

- Pretrained object detection (YOLO)
- Custom-built Kalman Filter tracker
- Motion estimation
- Time-to-Collision (TTC) calculation
- Heuristic-based risk scoring

The main contribution of the project lies in the tracking and risk modeling layers rather than object detection.
